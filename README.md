# Landon Lloyd
Welcome to my Github Profile Page. All of my projects I have created are stored here! Thanks for visiting! :smile:

## About Me
I am a programmer learning how to code for fun. I am going through the FreeCodeCamp Curriculum where I started from the very beginning. I have currently attained the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certifications. I am currently working through the Front-End-Libraries section, where I am learning more about jQuery. I found a love for programming at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown when I wanted to do something useful with my time. I will continue to keep learning and having fun with code and hopefully one day finish the FreeCodeCamp Curriculum!

## Currently Working On
I am currently working on completing the Front-End-Libraries section of FreeCodeCamp. Overall though I am working on completing the whole FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. I am also working on completing a game for the Game-Off-2020 game jam hosted by GitHub! :partying_face:

## Contributions
I am fairly new to Github and have been learning how to use it. I have made most of my contributions to a [Discord Bot named Becca-Bot](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/BeccaBot). I have also done a tiny bit of contributing to the FreeCodeCamp discord bot. I have also completed the HacktoberFest 2020 event which taught me a lot about contributing and how to use GitHub. I am working on getting better at contributing and love open source!
